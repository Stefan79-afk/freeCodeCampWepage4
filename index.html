                <p>
                    A simple way to think about classes is that they are like blueprints in the real world: In a blueprint, you clearly draw the schematics for 
                    a particular building you want to build, by defining its shape, its size and so on. In much the same way, a class is a blueprint for objects: 
                    you declare an object's variables, its methods(functions that they can call)
                </p>

                <h4>Objects</h4>
                <p>
                    If classes are the blueprint, then objects are the actual result of that blueprint.An object, also called instance of the class, is a 
                    data type composed of the class's variables that can use its methods.

                    The code above demonstrates the basics of classes and objects: the class <i><strong>Complex</strong></i> 
                    defines the blueprint/definition of a complex 
                    number, made from a real part and an imaginary part. The method/function <i><strong>display_nr</strong></i> simply outputs to the console the 2 
                    variables in the way a complex number is written. Then the object <i><strong>a</strong></i> gets declared, and its variables are given values. 
                    The object can call upon the method and have its values written in the usual form.

                <h4>What are they?</h4>
                <p>Access types refer to where the classe's contents can be used. A simple way to think about it is like asking for permission. 
                    Different types of access can or cannot offer permision for outside code to modify the data within the class.
                    The 3 different types are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Private</li>
                        <li>Public</li>
                        <li>Protected</li>
                    </ul>

                    They will all be expanded upon in the following paragraphs
                </p>

                <h4>Private</h4>
                <p>
                    By default, the variables of a class are declared as private, which means that they cannot be modified outside of the classe's scope. 
                    Similarly, if a function is declared in private, it cannot be called outside the class. It is often good practice to declare the 
                    variables of a class 
                    as private, in order to avoid illegal access and modifications.

                    Elements declared as public can be accessed from anywhere in the program, therefore making this type the most permissive. 
                    A class's methods are generally declared as public

                <p>
                    A protected element can be accessed by the class and classes that inherit it. Inheritance will be disscussed more in-depth

                <p>
                    A constructor is a special function that has no type and does not return anything. It is used to initialize the variables of an object. 
                    For example, in the code snippet above, instead of declaring each of <i><strong>a</strong></i>, we can do this instead:

                    It is also the only way to declare the variables if they are declared as private.

                <p>
                    In C++, you can manually allocate memory for variables or data structures, as well as free that memory. 
                    If variables are not manually allocated, they are deleted when the program exits their scope / when the program terminates. 
                    Therefore, objects follow the same principle. They are deleted when their scope ends / the program terminated.
                    Objects, like any other variable, can also be manually allocated in the heap, and can also be freed. The latter part is where the deconstructor comes in.
                    Like a Constructor, it is a special function that has no type and no return. It is simply used to free the memory of all the variables in the objects:

                <p>
                    Like in the real world, a class can <strong>inherit</strong> the attributes of another class. In Inheritance, the class that inherits is often called 
                    the <u>derived class</u>, while the class that is being inherited from is known as the <u>base class</u>.

                        class A<br>
                        {<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp//variables and methods<br>
                        };<br>
                        <br>
                        class B:public A<br>
                        {<br>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp//besides it's own attirbutes, B can also use A's, as long as they are not private.<br>
                        };<br>

                </div>

                <p>
                    In this example, class B inherits A's attirbutes publically. By publically, it means that it basically inherits everything that is not private 
                    (more on this later). Now, B can use A's functions and variables, if the respective variables/functions are public/protected.
                </p>

                <h4>Protected Access</h4>
                <p>
                    As mentioned before, access type protected is associated with the concept of Inheritance. If a variable in class A is declared as protected, 
                    then all classes that derive A(like B) have permission to modify the variable's value. Besides the derived classes, the variable is untouchable 
                    elsewhere in the program
                </p>

                <h4>Inheriting with public vs protected vs private</h4>
                <p>As you've seen in the code snippet above, class B inherited public A. To explain this easily, it's best to just showcase this with a code snippet:</p>

                <h4>What is Polymorphism?</h4>
                <p>
                    The word <i>Polymorphism</i> is composed of the words <i>Poly</i>, which means many and <i>morphism</i>, which means form. 
                    Therefore, polymorphism translates roughly to multiform. This defenition makes sense, given the way it works in OOP.
                    <br>
                    In OOP, polymorphism is generally thought of as a function that is shared between a base class and its derived classes with the same name that 
                    executes differently depending on the type(class) of the object. It basically changes its "form" depending on its class.

                        In the exmaple above, A is the base class, while B and C derive from A. All 3 classes have the same method <i><strong>display()</strong></i>, 
                        but print something different depending on their class 
                    </p>

                    <h4>Virtual Functions</h4>
                    <p>
                        A virtual function is basically a template function used in polymorphism. The base class's function is declared as virtual, 
                        which makes it unable to be executed unless using pointers. Then the derived classes use the same function(minus the virtaul keyword).
                        This is useful when an object of a derived class is accessed using a pointer of a base class: if the base class's function is not virtual, 
                        the pointer would call it. But if it's virtual, the pointer will instead call the function of the derived class's object

                <p>
                    A copy constructor is called when an object is assigned the value of another object. 
                    It basically handles the reassingment of the variables of the new object to the values of the assigned objects. 
                    Like a regular constructor, is has the name of the class and doesn't return anything.

                <h4>Operator Overloading</h4>
                <p>
                    Operator overloading, like function overloading, involves alterating the behavior of an operator(think +, -, and so on) under different circumstances. 
                    It is often used in OOP to define operations between objects. The simplest and most popular example is with string concatination: 
                    strings are objects, and so they overload the <strong>+</strong> to stick the 2 strings together
